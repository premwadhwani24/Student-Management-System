The Student Management System (SMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline student-related activities within educational institutions. Traditionally, tasks such as student record management, attendance tracking, and administrative operations were handled manually, leading to inefficiencies and a higher risk of errors. Our system aims to digitize these processes, ensuring improved accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The SMS features a user-friendly interface that supports two roles: Administrator and Student. Administrators have complete control over the system, allowing them to add and manage student records, update attendance, and categorize students based on their respective departments, ensuring a well-organized and structured data management approach. Students, on the other hand, can access their personal details and attendance status using their roll number. This system enhances transparency between students and management, reduces administrative workload, and eliminates the need for excessive paperwork. By automating routine tasks and offering real-time data retrieval, it significantly improves efficiency, ensures data security, and provides a scalable framework that can be expanded as needed. The Student Management System ultimately fosters a more organized, transparent, and technologically advanced approach to student administration.
